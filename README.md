# Memory card game [live demo](https://memory-card-game-odin-proj.vercel.app/)

Given 12 different pokemons, click on as many as you can without repeating a pokemon. Try to get a high score! 

## Technology 
- Vite
- React
- Vercel 

## What I learnt 
- useEffect for external interactions; in this case the pokeAPI to retrieve pokemons 
- useRef to persist data in a component across renders
- event handling and state changes
- module management
